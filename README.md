# ToDoApp-FlaskPython
Make a daily to do list,add or delete activies and control all through SQLite3 database

Hello everyone.                                       
I would like to add information how to use this program:                                          

1-First of all,you need to get Flask framework of Python according to your OS. Here is the official website of Flask to follow the instructions:                                                          
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/

All you need about Flask is in the website above.                                               

2-Then you need to download SQLite database to control your daily activities. Here is the link:                                 
https://www.sqlite.org/download.html                                                          

3-You need to paste all those files which are located in a zip/rar file into your C://.                           

4-And then here is one of the most important part,giving a path of that!
Copy the path of sqlite3.exe and follow the instructions:

*From the desktop, right click the Computer icon.                                                             
*Choose Properties from the context menu.                                                                       
*Click the Advanced system settings link. *Click Environment Variables. ...                                       
*In the Edit System Variable (or New System Variable) window, specify the value of the PATH environment variable.                               

5-You're going well! In order to have a better database view,I can suggest you to download the program below and you can see what's going on
on your database while you're adding or deleting your daily activities.
  
https://sqlitebrowser.org/                                

6- Flask uses http://localhost:5000 to see your project. I prefer use VS Code to compile the project. Open the integrated terminal (Under the View,or you can use Ctrl + ")                             
and command that:                                               
python todo.py                                      

Now you're ready to see the project. Go to http://localhost:5000 and make a daily list to do!                                           

Stay with Python!
